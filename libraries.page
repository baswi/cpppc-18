# OpenCV

Computer vision library.



# High Performance Computing

## DASH

A Partitioned Global Address Space library, mimicking STL for high performance
computing clusters. \
Containers: array, unordered_map, list, narray (n-dim. array) \
Algorithms: essential STL equivalents, some use cases under development, great scalability for distributed sorting

## HPX

Similar to DASH, task-parallel programming model. \
Containers: no STL-compliant containers (no global random access or not distributed) 
\
Algorithms: all STL algorithms, task-parallel implementations with robust scalability



## Blaze

The high performance math library. A real gem!



# C libraries

## FFTW

The "Fastest Fourier Transformation of the West", a must-have.

## ffmpeg

Video and audio encoder/decoder library. Second to none.


# Python Bindings

Writing Python modules in C++ is a breeze thanks to `pybind11`. \
Python owes its success in HPC and data science to modules implemented in C++ for
performance, like scipy and numpy.
