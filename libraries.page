# Boost

Period.

I have a specifically intense crush on the Boost Graph Library and Spirit.

Trivia: there are more people that have been in space than code
contributors to Boost.


# Signal Processing

## OpenCV

Computer vision library.

## FFTW (C library)

The "Fastest Fourier Transformation of the West", a must-have.

## ffmpeg (C library)

Video and audio encoder/decoder library. Second to none.



# High Performance Computing

## DASH

A Partitioned Global Address Space library, mimicking STL for high performance
computing clusters. \
Containers: array, unordered_map, list, narray (n-dim. array) \
Algorithms: essential STL equivalents, some use cases under development, great scalability for distributed sorting

## HPX

Similar to DASH, task-parallel programming model. \
Containers: no STL-compliant containers (no global random access or not distributed) 
\
Algorithms: all STL algorithms, task-parallel implementations with robust scalability



## Blaze

The high performance math library. A real gem!


# Machine Learning

## Tensorflow

Of course.




# Python Bindings

Writing Python modules in C++ is a breeze thanks to `pybind11`. \
Python owes its success in HPC and data science to modules implemented in C++ for
performance, like scipy and numpy.
