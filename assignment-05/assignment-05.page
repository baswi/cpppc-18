**C++ Programming Course, Summer Term 2018**

# 5-0 Have a Cookie

- Have a look at [cppinsights.io](https://cppinsights.io/).
- Understand what the tool does, experiment with it a bit.
- Rejoice.


# 5-1 Containers Revisited

- [Session 5 notes](/session-05/) and [discussed example](/session-05/01-move/)
- [Common misconception with C++ move semantics](https://pagefault.blog/2018/03/01/common-misconception-with-cpp-move-semantics/)

## 5-1-0 CppCon and Chill

Watch these talks:

- [Don't Help the Compiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKtHxKJRwp4)
- [Practical Performance Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzF4u9KgUWI)

These talks address a rather experienced (5+ years in industry) audience.
Pay close attention, pause, think, rewatch. It will be overwhelming, that's okay. 


## 5-1-1 list<T> Move Semantics

- Add a test case to the test suite of `List<T>` from
  [assignment 3](/assignment-03/) to validate
  moving / copy elision of temporary `List<T>` objects.
- Validate that your test case in fact creates / copies / assigns temporary
  `List<T>` instances (gdb, [cppinsights.io](http://cppinsights.io),
  logging ... anything that works for you).
- Extend your implementation of `List<T>` from assignment 3 by move semantics.
- Validate that temporary instances are moved (use techniques from step 2).

## 5-1-2 sparse_array<T,N> Move Semantics

Same as 5-1-1 for `sparse_array<T,N>`:

- Add a test case to the test suite of `sparse_array<T,N>` from
  [assignment 4](/assignment-04/) to
  validate moving / copy elision of temporary `sparse_array<T,N>` objects.
- Validate that your test case in fact creates / copies / assigns temporary
  `sparse_array<T,N>` instances (gdb, [cppinsights.io](http://cppinsights.io),
  logging ... anything that works for you).
- Extend your implementation of `sparse_array<T,N>` from assignment 4 by move 
  semantics.
- Validate that temporary instances are moved (use techniques from step 2).
