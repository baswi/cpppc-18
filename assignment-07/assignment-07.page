# 7-1 Fixing the Google Tech Interview

Google has an official YouTube channel for recruiting software engineers
where they published this video of a staged tech interview, presumably to
demonstrate what Google would expect from candidates:

Regrettably, comments have been disabled for this video.

Wipe the floor with the C++ implementation that is showcased as an acceptable
solution (at [15:29](https://youtu.be/XKu_SEDAykw?t=15m29s) in the video):

1. Shake your head in disbelief and disgust
2. Provide an improved variant of the `HasPairWithSum` function \
   (feel free to also improve its name)
3. Provide use cases to explain in which numerous ways the original
   implementation is lacking and why your improvements are essential; \
   add insult to injury: discuss parallelization aspects in particular
4. Become aware that you got pretty good at C++



# 7-2 Act Like You Got a Pair

The utility template `std::pair<A,B>` is a useful companion due to its utmost
simplicity and predictability: just a struct of two values `first` and `second`
with independent types.

Experiment with minimal examples to answer the following questions:

- How do comparison operators of `pair<A,B>` depend on types `A` and `B`?
- How can we specify comparison of `pair<A0,B0>` and `pair<A1,B1>`? 
- What is the benefit of `std::get` over `pair.first` / `pair.second` \
  (use compiler explorer)
- Why don't we just always use `std::get`?

The most traditional ways to represent a range are:

- a pair of iterators
- a pair of an iterator and an offset

Implement as minimal proof-of-concepts:

- Specialize `std::make_pair` for iterator and offset, that is: \
  Define a variant of `std::make_pair(Iter,int)` which only matches parameter
  types `Iter` that provide a type definition `iterator_category`
- Define 
    - `std::begin(std::pair<Iter,int> p)` \
      returning `std::get<0>(p)`
    - `std::end(std::pair<Iter,int> p)` \
      returning `std::advance(std::get<0>(p), std::get<1>(p))`

Use compiler explorer to check that your specializations have no overhead.

A usage example:

~~~c++
std::vector<std::string> v {
   "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
   "Thursday", "Brainfryday", "Saturday", "Sunday" };

auto range = std::make_pair(v.begin(), 6);

for (const auto & value : range) {
   std::cout << value << '\n';
}
