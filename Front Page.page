# Where and Why C++ Matters

- The western world [needs you](/Obama_Computer_Science.mp4) and
  [C++](/Merkel_Cpp.mp4).

- Why Instagram ported Apache Cassandra from Java to C++: \
  [Open-sourcing a 10x reduction in Apache Cassandra tail latency](/files/Cassandra_Java_to_Cxx.pdf)
- [Should you Learn C++ in 2018?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xVrYnyQ04M) \
  He uses simple words, but the right words.
- [The Best Programming Language for High Performance](https://lemire.me/blog/2017/01/16/best-programming-language-for-high-performance-january-2017/) \
  An unemotional comparison

# Technical Lab Notes

   Pre-configured development environment (use `nvim`).
   Well-tested setup but current state is from late 2016 and will be updated soon.
   Until then, feel free to dist-upgrade.

# Selected Talks:

- [Ben Deane - "Using Types Effectively"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojZbFIQSdl8)
- [Nicolas Guillemot - "Design Patterns for Low-Level Real-Time Rendering"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdPeXJ0eiGc)
- [Arne Mertz - "Learning and Teaching Modern C++"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5wOrhL4ew8) \
  One of the talks that inspired the curriculum of this course
- ["Stop writing classes."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0) \
  Technically the talk is on Python the message is valid in general: Don't marry a paradigm
- [Sean Parent - "Inheritance is the Base Class of Evil"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIhUE5uUFOA) \
  How polymorphism does not mean what you think, and why inheritance is a bad choice
  to achieve it
- [Bjarne Stroustrup - "Object Oriented Programming without Inheritance"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcpSLRpOMJM) \
  In-depth discussion of inheritance, complements Sean Parent's talk
- [Jason Jurecka - "Game engine using STD C++ 11"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AjRD6mU96s) \
  A broad overview of language features that make C++ 11 the industry's favorite for code that matters
- [Chandler Carruth - "High Performance Code 201: Hybrid Data Structures"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vElZc6zSIXM&t=132s) \
  Why custom data structures are key - and how easy it is to implement them
- [Ben Deane - "Using Types Effectively"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojZbFIQSdl8) \
  A gentle introduction to the benefits of a Turing-complete type system
- [Marshall Clow - "STL Algorithms - why you should use them, and how to write your own"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Jl1fk3MkQ) \
  ... and why your C++ code is more efficient than performance-tuned C 
- [Jason Turner - "Practical Performance Practices"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzF4u9KgUWI) \
  The talk also gives a great and compact recapitulation of
  construction semantics (copy, move, assign). Jason also explains that constexpr is
  actually not needed in many cases (something I learned from this talk)
- [Ivan Cukic - "Functional reactive programming in C++"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2MmURgc6cU) \
  All you need to know (for now) about functional programming in C++
- [Greg Law - “GDB - A Lot More Than You Knew"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9Fkq1e6sg) \
  Pinky swear: learning GDB basics takes 30 minutes and will change your understanding
  of code and your machine for life - without effort
